## PROJECT

### PROVINCIAL

#### Ningbo University of Technology Online Judge System

This system is designed for the ACMers. It is known as "**MOE**est" UI so far in China. The website of this system is written in `ThinkPHP` framework and running in `CentOS 6.3`. The database is `MySQL`. And what's more, the ***judge-end*** is written in `C++` and running in `Windows 7` which the computer is connected directly with the server via wires.

What's more, it is this project that I won the first prize and 100, 000 CNY bonus in the Catch Cup.

### PROFITABLE

#### New World (Game)

It's a online game like a slot machine of Korea. The project is outsourced and I am responsible for the client rendering and logic. To be honest, the game is origin in **single game**, the engine is a wrapper for HGE (Haaf's Game Engine). Though it's not developing from zero, it also is a not small project.

By the way, this project is written in `C++`.

> PS: Due to the conflict between developers and customers, this game is no longer operational.

#### 7zcar

This is a Groupon Website for cars. It's my first work after graduated. I am the only developer of that company. So something like `System Architecture`, `Develop (Frontend, backend)`, `Server Configuration`, `Operation`, `Software Implementation` are all be done by myself. The operation system of server is `CentOS 6.3` and the server software is **Tengine** (An open-source server software by TAOBAO, modified from **Nginx**). The database is using `MySQL` and `MongoDB`, and the website is using `ThinkPHP` framework. `PHP-CLI` is used for the process of sending email and SMS queue. `SevenzJS` (An open-source NODE.JS framework by me) is used for the server of `4S Shop client` and that client is written in `C#`.

> PS: Aha, I said that I am the only developer. As a result, all of my superiors don't know any IT knowledge. This project beyond their budget. I am **fired** after I finishing this project and this project is canceled.

#### F-FINE

It's a works-show website of f-fine studio. Website written in PHP.

#### aquaMobile

This project is finish during my time in Madrid, Spain. It's the new version of company's official website. Written in `CodeIgniter` framework. But it is still not in use after I come back to China.

### LEARNING

#### Secret Garden

It's an **H** Arkanoid game. The background image is a naked girl and the brick is theirs clothes. This game is write for a Japanese painter called ***須原くるり***. She wanted to enter some animation company in Japan, so she had to have some works. She paints, I program. Now she is in one animation company, so her [personal show website](http://www.suhara-nasuta.com/) is no longer available.

But you can see the video [here](http://video.sina.com.cn/v/b/76696149-2686947735.html). The girl said the developer is an India because my blog is [http://xcoder.in/](http://xcoder.in), that is the suffix is `.in`.

And I have the game and code.

#### Remake Version of Paralines Zero

At first, Paralines Zero is an **AVG Game** that developed by [Maoyumi Company](http://hi.baidu.com/maoyumi). And due to my love for programming and AVG games, I decided to remake it. The origin game is written in `Action Script` and I remake it by `XAE` (A wrapper framework or engine of HGE by myself). The resources are cracked from the origin one. And I had asked the developer, they don't care about it because it is free.

> [Download](http://115.com/lb/5lbfotzz). By the way, the link is one of previous version. The final version is in my computer.

#### XKTV

My 2011's curriculum design. It's a KTV system which include singing-end, demand-end, reception-desk-end and administrator-end. The database is `M$ SQL` and the singing-end and the demand-end is using HGE. `ØMQ` is used for the communication between singing-end and demand-end. Reception-desk-end and the administrator-end is written in `C#`.
