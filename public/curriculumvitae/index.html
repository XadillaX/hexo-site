<h2 id="INTRODUCE">INTRODUCE</h2>
<p>I dived into programming because I want to create a game of my own world at first. I went to ACM/ICPC programming contest for several times, and for this, I believe in my algorithm level.</p>
<p>I built the ACM/ICPC training team for my alma mater, and I have several mentees that trained by me. What’s more, I wrote the <a href="http://acm.nbut.edu.cn/">Online Judge System</a> for my alma mater.</p>
<p>I created many independent games during my Bachelor time, almost of them were based on a game engine, HGE or a game engine built by myself called XAE.</p>
<p>When I went to Zhejiang University, I came across with <code>Node.js</code> and then I fell in love with her. I think she’s so elegant and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>On 25th, November 2013, I received en email from a Google England Talent Scout. He invited me to discuss if I was fit for their engineering/research teams.</strong> But what a pity, after I’ve discussed with him, I knew that they were hiring full-time employees but not intern students.</p>

<h3 id="Ningbo_University_of_Technology_Online_Judge_System">Ningbo University of Technology Online Judge System</h3>
<p>This system is designed for the ACMers. It is known as “<strong>MOE</strong>est” UI so far in China. The website of this system is written in <code>ThinkPHP</code> framework and running in <code>CentOS 6.3</code>. The database is <code>MySQL</code>. And what’s more, the <strong><em>judge-end</em></strong> is written in <code>C++</code> and running in <code>Windows 7</code> which the computer is connected directly with the server via wires.</p>
<p>What’s more, it is this project that I won the first prize and 100, 000 CNY bonus in the Catch Cup.</p>

<h3 id="New_World_(Game)">New World (Game)</h3>
<p>It’s a online game like a slot machine of Korea. The project is outsourced and I am responsible for the client rendering and logic. To be honest, the game is origin in <strong>single game</strong>, the engine is a wrapper for HGE (Haaf’s Game Engine). Though it’s not developing from zero, it also is a not small project.</p>
<p>By the way, this project is written in <code>C++</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: Due to the conflict between developers and customers, this game is no longer operational.</p>

<h3 id="7zcar">7zcar</h3>
<p>This is a Groupon Website for cars. It’s my first work after graduated. I am the only developer of that company. So something like <code>System Architecture</code>, <code>Develop (Frontend, backend)</code>, <code>Server Configuration</code>, <code>Operation</code>, <code>Software Implementation</code> are all be done by myself. The operation system of server is <code>CentOS 6.3</code> and the server software is <strong>Tengine</strong> (An open-source server software by TAOBAO, modified from <strong>Nginx</strong>). The database is using <code>MySQL</code> and <code>MongoDB</code>, and the website is using <code>ThinkPHP</code> framework. <code>PHP-CLI</code> is used for the process of sending email and SMS queue. <code>SevenzJS</code> (An open-source NODE.JS framework by me) is used for the server of <code>4S Shop client</code> and that client is written in <code>C#</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS: Aha, I said that I am the only developer. As a result, all of my superiors don’t know any IT knowledge. This project beyond their budget. I am <strong>fired</strong> after I finishing this project and this project is canceled.</p>

<p>I was the backend developer of this project and I used “Node.js”. It’s an O2O mobile app that maks goods cheaper.</p>
